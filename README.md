# Installation 

Make sure you have the newest Nvidia JetPack to avoid issues.

1. Update package manager

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

2. You will need OpenCV 4.4+ for CUDA DNN support. Install it with [this script](https://github.com/mdegans/nano_build_opencv/blob/master/build_opencv.sh):

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdegans/nano_build_opencv/master/build_opencv.sh
./build_opencv.sh
```

3. Download AI Thermometer

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tomek-l/ai-thermometer
cd ai-thermometer
```

4. Run AI Thermometer

```shell
export DISPLAY=:0 # (if accessing via ssh). It might also be DISPLAY=:1
python3 main.py
```

# FAQ/common issues:

### 1. uvc_open error -3

Reason: Your current user does not have r/w access to the PureThermal USB device. 

For a quick and dirty fix you can do do:
```shell
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb",  ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/10-libuvc.rules 
sudo udevadm trigger
```
(this gives camera access to all users)

For a better, fine-grained permission setup, create a new group, give permissions to that group only and your user to the newly created group. You can read more [here](http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera#Permissions).

### 2. Illegal instruction (core dumped)

Reason: The provided  ```libuvc.so``` is compiled for AArch64.
It is a custom version of libuvc that supports Y16 video format. If you're using different architecture, you will need to build the library from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/groupgets/libuvc
cd libuvc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cp libuvc.so ~/ai-thermometer/ir/libuvc_wrapper
```

### 3. Using sudo

You dont't need ```sudo``` to run any code in this repository 🙂
